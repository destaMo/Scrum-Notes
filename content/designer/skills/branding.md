**Points:** 2

**Description:** You know what the process of creating a logo looks like. You are able to prepare a logo that match the brand values. You are able to handle the customer from selling the service to sending the final files.

**Required before proceeding with this block:**

- Basic color knowledge
- Handling vector and raster graphics programs (e.g. Photoshop and Illustrator)
- Basic knowledge of typography
- Access to books: “Logo Design Love”, “Jak zaprojektować doskonałe logo”, “Logo modernism” (all available in the Selleo library)

**Person who completed requirements for a given block can:**

**Note:**

Developing a good logo is a creative process therefore there is no one right method. The knowledge presented in this block is subjective and serves more as guidance than as a source of one right truth. In Selleo's resources we have 3 books that you need to go through this course. Although not required, I recommend reading them in full. They are a great source of knowledge and stimulate imagination and creativity :)
