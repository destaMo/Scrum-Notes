# GNU Linux System

## ðŸŽ“ Learning

- ðŸ“— [Linux Fundamentals](http://linux-training.be/linuxfun.pdf)
- ðŸ“— [Introduction to Linux](http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/intro-linux.pdf)
- ðŸ“™ [Linux 101 Hacks](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/linux-101-hacks-ebook/)

## ðŸ“¦ UNIX File types

- `-` regular file (text file)
- `d` directory
- `s` unix socket (unix sockets are much faster than communication over ip interface)
- `c` character device (terminal)
- `b` block device (like a terminal but receives blocks)
- `f` named pipeline (created by `mkfifo`)

> everything is a file

### ðŸ“¦ Outputs & inputs (aka file descriptors)

- `0` - stdin
- `1` - stdout
- `2` - stderr
- `>` - other

> created every time a program needs to interact with files

They are split, user can redirect them to different outputs (other streams, files, sockets).

`2>&1` redirects a standard error to a standard output so they appear together and can be jointly redirected to an output.

> **NOTE** `2>1` redirects a standard error to a file called `1`
> **NOTE** `ls > /dev/null 2>&1` or `unknowncommand > /dev/null 2>&1` means that no outputs are printed on terminal

## ðŸ“¦ Useful commands

1. please read manual (at least description) for each command
1. you can use documentation during the interview
1. if you get `command not found`, try to install it with `brew` or `apt` or any other package manager.

> **NOTE** just explore a command - please do not learn all possible options
> **NOTE** during testing please be careful with using `rm*` commands

## ðŸ“¦ Streams and operators

- `>`
```
$ ls -la > files.txt`
# saves list of files to a file, and overwrite an existing value or creates a new file
```
- `>`
```
$ ls -la >> files.txt`
# saves list of files to a file, and append to existing value or creates a new file
```
- `<`
```
$ echo 'hello world' > output
$ cat <output
hello world
```
- `<<`
```
$ cat <<EOF
  > hello
  > world
  > EOF
```
- `|` - pipe eg. `ls | head -2` prints first two files
- `&` - move process to background
- `&&` - logical `AND` operator
- `||` - operator `OR` operator
- `!` - logical `NOT` operator

## ðŸ“¦ /proc filesystem

- `cmdline` - how the process was launched
- `cwd` - current working directory
- `environ` - runtime variables
- `exec` - executable (symlink)
- `fd` - opened file descriptors
- `limits` - "ulimit" for the process
- `mounts` - how processes sees mounted filesystem

> and many many ... many more different properties

## ðŸ“¦ ownership

```bash
$ touch file.txt
$ ls -lah | grep file
-rw-r--r--  1 bard bard    0 Jan 16 09:50 file.txt
$ chown root:root file.txt # sets owner to root user and root group
$ sudo chown root:root file.txt # but it requires a root privileges
$ mkdir tmp
$ touch tmp/test1.txt tmp/test2.txt # creates two files in tmp directorys
$ sudo chown -R root:root tmp # sets owner to root:root for all files in tmp directory recursively
```

## ðŸ“¦ permissions

```bash
$ touch file.txt
$ mkdir tmp
$ ls -la | grep -E "file|tmp"
-rw-r--r--  1 bard bard    0 Jan 16 09:50 file.txt
drwxr-xr-x  2 bard bard 4096 Jan 16 09:55 tmp
```

| file type | owner | group | others |
|:--------- |:----: |:-----:| ------:|
| `-`       | `rw-` | `r--` | `r--`  |
| `d`       | `rwx` | `r-x` | `r-x`  |

- file type `-` means that is a regular file
- `rw-` - file can be read/written by owner
- `r--` - file can be read group
- `r--` - file can be read other system users
- file type `d` means that is a directory (more file types could be found above
  in section [UNIX file types](#unix-file-types))
- `rwx` - directory can be read/written/executed by owner (by executed it means
  that owner can list files or enter to a directory)
- `r-x` - directory can be read/executed

### number and character values

- READ (r) = 4
- WRITE (w) = 2
- EXECUTE (x) = 1

``` bash
4 + 2 + 1 => 7 RWX
4 + 1 => 5 RX
1 => 1 WX
```

```bash
$ chmod 751 test.bin # can be executed by every single user, can be read by owner and users from the group, owner has a full control
```

```bash
$ chmod -x test.bin # removes execute permissions
$ chmod +x test.bin # add execute permission to user/group/others
$ chmod u+x test.bin # add execute permission to owner
$ chmod g+x test.bin # add execute permission to group
$ chmod ug+x test.bin # add execute permission to owner and group
$ chmod ugo+x test.bin # add execute permission to owner, group and others (it does the same like +x)
```

## ðŸ“¦ System services

### Setting hostname/domain name of own local server

Edit one of these files (depends on your OS):

- `/etc/hosts` - OSX (some says that it's valid for Debians as well)
- `/ets/hostname` - Debian familly OS

and add

```
127.0.0.1       bard.dev
```

and you can ping `bard.dev` or use the address in a web browser

### SSH

SSH (*secure shell*) is a network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. It works with client-server architecture and allows to execute commands (through terminal) on a remote servers.
It uses a key or passphrase to auto authorize and authenticate an access to a user on remote server.

> **NOTE**: SSH server allows to use `scp` or `rsync`.

#### Enable SSH server on OSX

- System preferences
- Sharing
- and check `Remote Login` option

#### Enable SSH server on GNU Linux

Just follow steps from [community notes](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring) or install
`sshd` packaged.

### Public Key and Private Keys

> **NOTE** *please do not share your private keys with anyone*

> **NOTE** you can use your public key for an authentication with foreign server

![pub_vs_pem](https://www.comodo.com/images/support/certs3.jpg)
![sign_with_pem](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Public_key_signing.svg)

#### Generate keys

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "bob@keys.dev"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/bard/.ssh/id_rsa): bob_key
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in bob_key.
Your public key has been saved in bob_key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:G0bIuTKmbPyOWOkhl+hqswT5/zAuWmqkVLxFbn6HgkU bob@keys.dev
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+

```

#### Generate a public key based on private key

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -y -f bob_key > bob_key_2.pub
```

## ðŸ“¦ Linux daemons / services

Daemons are background processes in Linux systems. Most of deamons have names that end with the letter `d` e.g. `memcached`, `sshd`. Scripts stored in `/etc/init.d/` or `/etc/rc.d/` directories are used to manage deamons statuses.

```bash
$ /etc/init.d/sshd start
$ /etc/init.d/sshd stop
$ # or
$ service sshd restart
```

> **NOTE** depends on sysmte daemon/process manager might be different eg `systemctl`

## ðŸ“¦ Useful tricks

- `<space>command` - the command will not be saved in history
- `<command> --help | less`

### Command Editing Shortcuts

- `Ctrl + a` - go to the start of the command line
- `Ctrl + e` - go to the end of the command line
- `Ctrl + k` - delete from cursor to the end of the command line
- `Ctrl + u` - delete from cursor to the start of the command line
- `Ctrl + w` - delete from cursor to start of word (i.e. delete backwards one word)
- `Ctrl + y` - paste word or text that was cut using one of the deletion shortcuts (such as the one above) after the cursor
- `Ctrl + xx` - move between start of command line and current cursor position (and back again)
- `Alt + b` - move backward one word (or go to start of word the cursor is currently on)
- `Alt + f` - move forward one word (or go to end of word the cursor is currently on)
- `Alt + d` - delete to end of word starting at cursor (whole word if cursor is at the beginning of word)
- `Alt + c` - capitalize to end of word starting at cursor (whole word if cursor is at the beginning of word)
- `Alt + u` - make uppercase from cursor to end of word
- `Alt + l` - make lowercase from cursor to end of word
- `Alt + t` - swap current word with previous
- `Ctrl + f` - move forward one character
- `Ctrl + b` - move backward one character
- `Ctrl + d` - delete character under the cursor
- `Ctrl + h` - delete character before the cursor
- `Ctrl + t` - swap character under cursor with the previous one
- `Ctrl + r` - search the history backwards
- `Ctrl + g` - escape from history searching mode
- `Ctrl + p` - previous command in history (i.e. walk back through the command history)
- `Ctrl + n` - next command in history (i.e. walk forward through the command history)
- `Alt + .` - use the last word of the previous command

> **NOTE** under OSX please set your `ALT` key as `ESC+`
> **NOTE** some keybinds might not work due to different implementation of terminal or shell

### Command Control Shortcuts

- `Ctrl + l` - clear the screen
- `Ctrl + s` - stops the output to the screen (for long running verbose command)
- `Ctrl + q` - allow output to the screen (if previously stopped using command above)
- `Ctrl + c` - terminate the command
- `Ctrl + z` - suspend/stop the command (such command can be restored with `fg`)

> **NOTE** some keybinds might not work due to different implementation of terminal or shell

### CommandBangBang

- `!!` - run last command
- `!blah` - run the most recent command that starts with â€˜blahâ€™ (e.g. !ls)
- `!blah:p` - print out the command that !blah would run (also adds it as the latest command in the command history)
- `!$` - the last word of the previous command (same as Alt + .)

> **NOTE** some command bangs might not work due to different implementation of shell
