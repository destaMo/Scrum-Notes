### üìù Katas
**All the infrastructure should be setup using Terraform**

Create a small AWS infrastructure for a backend application that can be found [here](https://github.com/qbart/hello-ruby-sinatra). The following resources should be used:
- VPC + NAT Gateway
- Security Groups
- EC2
- ECS
- ALB
- Autoscaling Groups(no upscale and downscale required for now)

**Notes**
You can use module for VPC and NAT setup that can be found [here](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws/latest)
Backend should have a proper DNS setup.
Prepare CI pipeline for the backend application similar to the one for frontend
