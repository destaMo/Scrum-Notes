### 🎓 Learn
 
* 📗 [Article on image compression](https://medium.com/@arekjanik/compressing-assets-for-web-dbfd25674c2e?sk=8a53480e19ae65bf2a6343b32af63b46)
* 📗 [Different formats walkthrough](https://gizmodo.com/what-s-the-difference-between-jpg-png-and-gif-5656669)
* 📗 Always make sure the images you use are properly sized and compressed. For large images use the real size that they're displayed on, eg. if the content's width is 1200px resize the image to 1200px. For smaller images like 300px you can save them at 2x the size to make sure it's rendered nicely on Retina. Use JPG for photos and images with a lot of colour, for simpler images try PNG or even better - vector SVG. Don't use GIF, PNG is always better.
* 📗 [Compressing tool](https://squoosh.app/)
* 📗 Compress using the following options:
    * MozJPEG ~89 for smaller photos
    * MozJPEG ~80 for larger ones
    * OxiPNG 256 colors, dithering enabled
    * Browser WebP, quality 0.9 [more on that](https://selleo.com/til/posts/9kdnziefk3-great-case-for-webp-format)
