### üé§ Interview

**IMPORTANT TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION:**

- "Composition over Inheritance" - explain what is it and what can happen when you neglect this principle?
- "Single-Table Inheritance vs. Polymorphic Associations" - explain when to use each of them, what kind of problems will they help you solve and what problems they can cause if you select wrong thing
- "Asynchronous processing" - what is it? What tools can you use to implement it? What are pros and cons of introducing asynchronous processing in your application? When to use it?
- "Caching" - what is it? Compare page/action/fragment/partial/low level caching? What are pros and cons of using caching in your application? When to use it?
- "Microservices Oriented Architecture" - Compare it to monolith application. When to use? How communication between services looks like? What are the potential problems? What are the things that you should pay special attention to during design and implementation?
- "JSON API vs GraphQL API vs REST API" - what are the pros and cons of using them? When will you suggest one over another?

**OTHER QUESTIONS:**
