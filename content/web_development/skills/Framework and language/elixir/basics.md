### 📝 Katas

Create an application with Phoenix Framework which contains:
- Registration
- JWT based authentication
- Roles based authorization
- At least 3 entities logically connected with each other
- Email notifications(at least one)
- Sorting
- Pagination

The app should be exposed as REST API

All critical features should be covered with automated tests.

If you don't have an idea what app you could create, you could crate a close of sth popular like. Twitter, 9gag,
Meetup.com or use real world https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api

All of above feature can be checked via different projects(already done side projects/commercial project/open source)
