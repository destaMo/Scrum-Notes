## Understanding the Business

In this step we care the most about understanding the big picture of our customer's product. The big picture vision helps us to ask vital questions and spot incorrect decisions during other stages of planning.

## Preparing Epics

## Preparing Stories

In this step we have Epics and Features, but they are too abstract to effectively track and commit to. Our goal in this step is to create Stories that will let us divide Features into smaller chunks, which makes it easier to ship meaningful working parts of the new Feature.
