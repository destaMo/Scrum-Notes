**Points:** 2

- Can effectively divide and prioritise the scope of work into individual tasks with adequate granularity
- Prioritises tasks to address risks, challenges and unknowns early in the process
- Describes tasks in an unambiguous way so those are easily addressable - provides clear acceptance criteria, reasoning, developer guidelines and other helpful assets when necessary (not necessarily ""micro-manages"" tasks)

## Understanding the Business

In this step we care the most about understanding the big picture of our customer's product. The big picture vision helps us ask vital questions and spot incorrect decisions during other stages of planning.

## ðŸ“¦ Business Roadmap

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- ðŸ“— [104 Questions for Product Development Teams](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/104-questions-for-product-development-teams-5bc2dbae690e) (Paragraphs **Goal and Vision** and **Problem**)

### ðŸŽ¤ Interview

- Which answers do you seek when communicating with customer about the next feature?
- How much people and who do you introduce to a call about next feature?

## Preparing Epics

In this step we start creating Epics and Features from our customer's requirements. Having the big picture overview from the last step we can focus on next areas of the product.

## ðŸ“¦ Defining Epics

### ðŸŽ¤ Interview

- What is the Definition of Done?
- How do you set the Definition of Done for Epics?

---

## Preparing Stories

In this step we have Epics and Features, but they are too abstract to effectively track and commit to. Our goal in this step is to create Stories that will let us divide Features into smaller chunks, which makes it easier to ship meaningful working parts of the new Feature.

- How do you make sure that the story can be picked by someone else on the go?

---

## Planning

As you can already see we need to do a lot of preparation before we start the planning session. A good preparation however makes the process more reliable and possibly answers 90% of the questions that would otherwise appear during the development phase.

In this step we already have Stories that represent user flows and shippable part. We've discussed _what_ we need to ship and we should focus now on _how_ we want to ship it. We'll enhance Stories with Tasks within them to make it clearer on what flow we want to achieve or any technicality behind it.

## Good Practices

This place is a sink for all good practices that we've gathered with years of experience.

## ðŸ“¦ Good Practices / Collecting your Experience
