### 📝 Katas

- Setup I18n and l10n for the application:
  - minimum 2 languages (one of them must have few plural forms of nouns e.g. Polish: 1 opinia, 2 opinie..., 5 opinii) - recommended Polish and English
  - app should remember the last selected language
  - show how we can deal with missing translations (e.g. defaultValue or fallback)
  - displaying current date based on selected language (formatting)
  - correct form of a noun based on number(e.g. 1 opinia, 2 opinie, 5 opinii/1 opinion, 2 opinions,... 5 opinions) 
  - combining translations with HTML elements (e.g. text from the translation with a link/bolded word in the middle of it like: "This text is from **tr0anslation** and there is [link](https://google.com) for google.com.")
