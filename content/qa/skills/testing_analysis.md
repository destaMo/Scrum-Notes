### **🎤  Interview**

- What is the relation between bug's severity and priority?
- Why do we need to set the priorities of reported bugs?
- Why do we need to analyse the risk of impact of a change? How to use technical knowledge to recognize risks? How could domain knowledge help?
- What are the main characteristics of a high-quality business requirements? Why are they so important?
- How can we apply Pareto principle in testing?
- What are the most important of the QA activities? How to manage and prioritize them in case of limited velocity?
- Is it important to know the details of the implementation? How to find a good balance between technical and business knowledge? In what ways the technical knowledge can help the QA engineer?
- What kind of information about end-users should you gather during project onboarding? How will it improve your testing?
