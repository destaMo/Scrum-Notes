# DevOps - docker / docker compose / docker for development

technology lead: Bartlomiej Danek

## 📦 Docker

### 🎓 Learn

- What is Docker?
  - Docker is an open source tool for running isolated containers on Linux making the deployment of apps inside containers faster. Docker creates portable, self-sufficient containers from any application.
  - The same container that the developer builds and tests on his PC can run in production, on VMs, in the cloud and a lot more places.
- Why should I use Docker?
  - consistent development environment for entire team - you need only Docker to develop
  - it helps to minimize the differecens between local and production environments
  - environment is isolated from developer's OS and other tools

#### 📗 Exercise 1

- Prepare a *Dockerfile* which will run [sample script](https://github.com/Selleo/docker_sample_script)

#### 📗 Exercise 2

- Prepare a *Dockerfile* which will install a working (nodejs, npm, yarn) environment for a nodejs application in version defined in `NODE_VERSION` environment variable.

#### 📗 Exercise 4

- Prepare a *Dockerfile* for one of 3rd part services (database, cache storage, search engine etc.) what you use in one of your apps.
Replace the service by a service served by Docker.

#### 📗 Exercise 5

- Prepare a working *docker-compose.yml* file which will run [advanced rails application](https://github.com/Selleo/docker_sample_app).

* Rails 5.2 application with Ruby 2.5.1
* PostgreSQL 10.5
* Redis 4.0
* Memcached 1.5

The app is using:
